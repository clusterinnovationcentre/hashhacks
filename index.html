                                    A registration fees of Rs. 300 will have to be paid online to confirm attendance once the applicant is selected. This includes meals, drinks, snacks, overnight hosting, mentorship, swag, awesome prizes and a memorable experience (if we do say so ourselves)! Just ask your friends/seniors who attended last time if you know any. Honestly, the appreciation we solicited last time is what propels us to continue hosting awesome events.
